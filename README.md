#Project Two - Dinah

https://floating-bastion-5830.herokuapp.com/

##Technologies used
####HTML/CSS and Bootstrap skeletons
####Javscript/jQuery
####MongoDB/Mongoose
####Node
####The sheer will to live

##Approach
1. Built MVC
2. Fleshed out files
3. Mapped out routes
4. Decided what the routes should do
5. Wrote a comprehensive checklist
6. Fleshed out basic schemas
7. Built server
8. Fleshed out basic controllers
9. Enhanced and improved models and controllers
10. Very, very minimal HTML/CSS and styling -- purposefully focused on honing understanding mongoose, express and node

##Unsolved Issues
1. Toggle for upvote/downvote does not work, unfortunately.
2. HTML/CSS could use some tweaks, but it's clean and functional
3. Enhance more of the client-facing features. Ran out of time to work on pull box/subscriptions for customers.
4. Clean up code significantly.
5. More sleep is direly needed.

##Lessons Thus Far
1. MVC is your friend. Don't take it for granted. Ever.
2. Making mistakes actually helps you understand concepts better. I now have a fleshed out understanding of mongoose and how everything integrates.
3. Be patient and push often to your git. Although this project was considerably less stressful than the first, if I took more time to pause and deeply think I could have actually saved time.
4. Prep time is crucial. Had I had a more concise idea of a theme or purpose for my site, I probably would have had an easier time structuring it.
